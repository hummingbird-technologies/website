          Inspired by Kiva Systems, a former mobile robotics startup now operating as Amazon Robotics,
          Hummingbird Technologies uses an innovative design to create their own automated multifunctional
          logistics robot with the potential for further optimizing operations at inventory distribution
          (four corner-mounted, independently steered and powered wheel modules) allow for fully decoupled
          translation and continuous rotation of the drive base at over 1 meters pers second, all while
           carrying a weight of 500 pounds!
          </p>
          <p>As such, it is more maneuverable and
          cost-effective than its predecessor, ready to revolutionize the warehouse logistics robot.

            <h3>Mechanical Design</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
            To achieve fully-independent translation and rotation along with continuous rotation, existing
            swerve drivetrains often have two major drawbacks. Their innate mechanical complexity often
            leads to elevated part counts, and emphasis on packing factor and minimizing weight rarely
            allow design for manufacturability (DFM) or design for assembly (DFA) considerations to prevail.
            Because of the perceived industrial application’s emphasis on durability and maintenance, the
            design sought to achieve the desired 500 lb load rating while minimizing part count and
            achieving better DFM results.
            </p>
            <p>
            Replacing spur geartrains with timing belt reductions on the drive stage and an off-the-shelf
            planetary gearbox (linked to the wheel module by a 1:1 belt) on the turning stage reduced
            the amount of hardware and number of custom parts.
            </p>
            <p>
            The wheel module itself also minimizes part count and eases manufacturing complexity by utilizing
            a single-piece aluminum extrusion sleeve with externally captured bearings.

            <h3>Electrical Design</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
              With 4 modules each with two motors, one for rotation and one for translation, the
              robot packs a lot of electrical complexity. Each motor is driven by a motor controller
              that receives PWN input and has an encoder for measuring its position. Inputs and outputs
              from each of the eight motors make their way to the myRIO micro-controller via a set of
              bread boards.
            </p>
            <p>
              For meeting our target load of 500 pounds, we use CIM motors for translation which can draw
              upto 60 A at 12 V! We outfitted the robot with a 150 A breaker and individual fuses on each
              motor power line. We have a big red "E-stop" button on the breaker. And we use two wheelchair
              batteries to power the whole setup!
            </p>
            <p>
              Since the electric circuit shared by the motor and motor controllers can often have very
              strange transients during operation, we use a separate 11.1 V LiPo battery to power the
              myRIO and router bundle.

            <br>
            We have a lot of software design in LabView as well, where we place many things
            and hold them in different places to get different outcomes.

            <h3>Graphical User Interface</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
              The robot is controlled with a gamepad or a joystick wirelessly. It therefore needs
              no digital GUI for feeding in inputs.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, we created an interface for outputing the speed and pointing direction of
              each module of the robot. This interface is meant for analyzing the performance of
              the robot. An operator can look at these outputs and potentially change the control
              parameters of the robot to achieve better performance.
